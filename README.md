# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## Dataset Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `data.csv`: Dataset from Kaggle in csv format
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project (You are reading it right now!).
- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Setup**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/vakandrii/titanic-survival-prediction.git
      ```
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `titanic.ipynb` in your browser.
